# Cosmoria - AGENTS.md

This document defines rules and guidelines for AI agents, automated tools, and contributors interacting with the Cosmoria codebase.

Cosmoria is a backend engine for building multi-tenant applications on PostgreSQL.

---

# 🧠 Core Principles

Any agent working in this repository must respect the following principles:

## 1. Multi-tenancy is mandatory

All data access MUST be scoped by:
- project_id
- tenant_id

Never trust client-provided identity or tenant values.

---

## 2. Backend is the source of truth

The backend is responsible for:
- authentication
- authorization
- tenant isolation
- data validation

Frontend or external clients must never enforce security rules.

---

## 3. Minimal dependencies

Cosmoria prefers:
- standard library usage
- minimal external dependencies
- explicit over abstracted logic

Avoid unnecessary frameworks.

---

## 4. Clear separation of concerns

- `api/` → HTTP layer only
- `internal/` → business logic
- `core/` → system orchestration
- `db/` → database access only

No mixing responsibilities.

---

# 🔐 Security Rules

## Authentication

- JWT or API keys must be validated on every request
- Passwords must be hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or argon2)
- Tokens must have expiration

---

## Authorization

- RBAC must be enforced at request level
- Every action must verify permissions
- Role checks must never be skipped

---

## Data Isolation

Every query MUST include:
- project_id
- tenant_id

Any omission is considered a critical security bug.

---

# 👑 Admin System Rules

Cosmoria has two separate auth systems:

## Platform Admins (`admin_users`)

Administrators of the Cosmoria platform itself (not end-users of built apps).

- `admin_users` table stores: id, email, password_hash, role, created_at
- Roles: `super_admin` (full access), `admin` (limited, assigned per-project)
- Auth via JWT with `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` (separate from user `JWT_SECRET`)
- API endpoints under `/api/admin/` prefix

## Per-Project Admin Permissions (`admin_project_roles`)

- Granular roles assigned to `admin_users` per-project
- Stored in `admin_project_roles` table (admin_user_id, project_id, role)
- Only `super_admin` can assign/remove roles
- Permissions verified on every admin request by querying DB (not embedded in JWT)

## Bootstrap Flow

- First startup: `POST /api/admin/setup` creates the initial `super_admin` + default project
- Only works once (checks `admin_users` count)
- After setup: `POST /api/admin/login` for admin auth

---

# 🎭 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Rules

Cosmoria enforces per-project RBAC for SaaS end-users.

## Role Definitions

- Roles are created per-project by `super_admin` via API
- Each role has a set of `(resource, action)` permissions
- Supported resources: `tenants`, `collections`, `records`, `files`
- Supported actions: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`
- Wildcard `*` matches any resource or action

## User-Role Assignment

- Users are assigned to exactly one role per project (`user_project_roles` table)
- Role is NOT embedded in the JWT — queried from DB on every request
- Assignment managed by `super_admin` via `/api/admin/projects/{pid}/users/{uid}/role`

## Enforcement

- RBAC middleware wraps each user-facing route with `RequirePermission(svc, resource, action)`
- Middleware checks `auth.GetAuth(ctx)` for UserID + ProjectID
- Queries `CheckAccess(userID, projectID, resource, action) → bool`
- Supports wildcards: if a role has `(tenants, *)`, it covers all actions on tenants

## Admin routes

RBAC management endpoints are under `/api/admin/` and protected by admin auth (super_admin only).

---

# 📦 Collections System Rules

Collections define dynamic schemas stored in PostgreSQL.

Rules:
- Schema is stored as JSONB
- No direct SQL schema modifications per collection
- All CRUD must go through the collections engine
- Schema mutation is always permitted; existing records are NOT re-validated

---

# 📖 OpenAPI / Swagger Rules

Cosmoria generates an OpenAPI spec from Go handler annotations using `swaggo/swag`.

- **Every handler** MUST have swaggo annotations: `@Summary`, `@Description`, `@Tags`, `@Param`, `@Success`, `@Failure`, `@Router`
- **Auth-required routes** MUST include `@Security BearerAuth` or `@Security AdminBearerAuth`
- **Response types** in `{object}` MUST reference the actual Go struct (package.TypeName)
- The spec is served at `/docs/doc.json` and Swagger UI at `/docs/`
- To regenerate after changing annotations: `swag init -g cmd/cosmoria/main.go -o docs/`
- Generated files (`docs/docs.go`, `docs/swagger.json`, `docs/swagger.yaml`) are committed

---

# 🖥️ CLI Rules

All interaction goes through the `cosmoria` binary.

```
cosmoria serve              Start server (default)
cosmoria dev                Hot reload (watch .go → rebuild → restart)
cosmoria init               Generate .env, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile
cosmoria migrate new <name> Create migration pair
cosmoria migrate up/down    Run/revert migrations
cosmoria mcp                MCP server (JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout)
```

- The CLI uses only stdlib `flag` and `os.Args` — no cobra/urfave
- `serve` and `migrate` commands load config and connect to the database
- `dev` command compiles and runs a child binary, watching for `.go` file changes
- `init` command creates files in the current directory (not in `cmd/`)
- `mcp` command starts an MCP server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout)

---

# 📋 Declarative Config Rules (`cosmoria.yaml`)

Cosmoria applies a YAML config file at startup if `cosmoria.yaml` exists in the working directory.

```yaml
project: my-saas
tenants:
  - name: acme-corp
collections:
  - name: posts
    schema:
      fields:
        - { name: title, type: string, required: true }
        - { name: body, type: string }
roles:
  - name: editor
    permissions:
      - { resource: records, action: create }
```

Rules:
- All operations are **idempotent** — resources are matched by name inside the project
- If no `admin_users` exist, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars must be set
- The config file is applied **after** migrations, **before** the HTTP server starts
- Does NOT replace the REST API — it's a declarative alternative for initial setup
- Format is YAML only (not JSON, not TOML)
- Config lives in `internal/configfile/`: parser + applier

---

# 🤖 MCP Server Rules

`cosmoria mcp` exposes Cosmoria tools via the Model Context Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout).

## Transport

- **Stdio**: reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC from stdin, writes responses to stdout
- **No HTTP transport** yet (planned for future)
- Logs go to stderr (never to stdout)

## Handshake (3 steps)

1. Client sends `initialize` → Server responds with capabilities
2. Client sends `notifications/initialized` → Server enters Ready state
3. Server responds to `tools/list` and `tools/call`

## Tools exposed (~19 tools)

| Group | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Setup | `cosmoria_setup` |
| Projects | `cosmoria_project_create`, `cosmoria_project_list` |
| Tenants | `cosmoria_tenant_create`, `cosmoria_tenant_list`, `cosmoria_tenant_get` |
| Collections | `cosmoria_collection_create`, `cosmoria_collection_list`, `cosmoria_collection_get` |
| RBAC | `cosmoria_role_create`, `cosmoria_role_list`, `cosmoria_role_set_permission`, `cosmoria_role_list_permissions` |
| Records | `cosmoria_record_create`, `cosmoria_record_list`, `cosmoria_record_get`, `cosmoria_record_update`, `cosmoria_record_delete` |
| Users | `cosmoria_user_assign_role` |

## Implementation

- Lives in `internal/mcp/`: types, server (message loop + dispatch), tools (definitions + handlers)
- Each tool handler calls the existing service layer (adminauth, tenant, collections, rbac, records)
- No authentication — the MCP server has direct DB access (local superuser)
- No new dependencies for stdio transport (stdlib only)
- State machine: `New → Initialized → Ready`

# 🎯 TypeScript SDK Rules

The TypeScript SDK lives at `sdk/typescript/`.

- Zero runtime dependencies — uses only `fetch`
- All methods return typed Promises
- Auto-generated `api.ts` from OpenAPI spec (via `scripts/generate-sdk.sh`)
- Hand-written `client.ts` provides the `CosmoriaClient` class
- After adding/modifying API endpoints:
  1. Add swaggo annotations to the handler
  2. Run `swag init -g cmd/cosmoria/main.go -o docs/`
  3. Run `./scripts/generate-sdk.sh`
  4. Update `client.ts` with the new method
- Auth tokens are passed via `client.setToken(token)` between requests

---

# 🔧 Zero-Config Rules

Cosmoria starts without any environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://localhost:5432/cosmoria?sslmode=disable` | Falls back silently |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Random 32-byte hex | Generated on startup (warns, tokens lost on restart) |
| `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` | Random 32-byte hex | Generated on startup (warns, tokens lost on restart) |

- Production deployments MUST set both JWT secrets explicitly
- The default DATABASE_URL expects PostgreSQL on localhost:5432
- `cosmoria init` generates a docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL for this
- Never remove the `slog.Warn` messages — they alert users to the ephemeral secrets

---

# 🔥 Hot Reload Rules

`cosmoria dev` uses `fsnotify` for inotify file watching.

- Watches all `.go` files recursively (excluding `.git` and hidden dirs)
- Debounces changes over 150ms to avoid rapid rebuilds
- On change: kills child process → rebuild → restart
- If build fails: the previous binary is restarted (not left dead)
- The dev binary is compiled to `/tmp/cosmoria-dev`
- Environment variables are inherited from the parent shell

---
